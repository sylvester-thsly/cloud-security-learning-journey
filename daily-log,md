## Tips for Using This Log

1. **Be honest** - Document struggles and failures, not just wins
2. **Be specific** - "Learned EC2" is vague, "Launched t2.micro instance and SSH'd into it" is better
3. **Update daily** - Even if just 5 minutes, keep the habit
4. **Review weekly** - Look back at what you accomplished
5. **Commit to GitHub** - Make your learning public and accountable
6. **Add screenshots** - Visual proof of your projects
7. **Link resources** - Include URLs to helpful tutorials/docs
8. **Track time honestly** - Helps you understand your pace
9. **Celebrate small wins** - Motivation is key for long journeys
10. **Don't skip days** - Even "studied 30 mins, felt tired" is valuable data
