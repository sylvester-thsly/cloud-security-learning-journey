### Day 1 - October 11, 2025
**Time Spent:** 2.5 hours


**What I Learned:**
- What cloud computing is and why companies use it
- Three deployment models:
  - **On-premises:** Your own physical servers in your building
  - **Cloud-based:** Everything runs on AWS servers (no physical hardware at your location)
  - **Hybrid:** Mix of both - some on-premises, some in cloud
- **AWS Global Infrastructure:**
  - **Regions:** Geographic locations (like US East, Europe) that contain multiple Availability Zones
  - **Availability Zones (AZs):** Separate data centers within a Region for redundancy
  - Benefits: High availability and fault tolerance
- **Client-Server Model:**
  - Client sends requests (your phone, browser)
  - Server processes and responds (AWS provides scalable servers)
  - Cloud computing provides the server side accessible over the internet
- **AWS Shared Responsibility Model:**
  - **AWS secures:** Physical infrastructure, data centers, hardware, networking equipment
  - **Customer secures:** Data, applications, operating system patches, encryption, user access
  - Simple rule: AWS = "Security OF the cloud" | Customer = "Security IN the cloud"

**Hands-On Practice:**
- Created AWS free tier account successfully
- Enabled MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) on root account for security
- Set up billing alerts to monitor spending and stay within free tier
- Got $100 in free credits valid for 183 days
- Explored AWS Management Console interface

**Challenges:**
- Initially confused about the difference between Regions and Availability Zones
- Understanding which security responsibilities belong to AWS vs customer took some thinking
- Quiz questions made me really think through concepts carefully

**Resources Used:**
- AWS Skill Builder: Cloud Practitioner Essentials - Module 1
- Completed Module 1 knowledge check quiz

**Quiz Results:**
- Scored well on deployment models, global infrastructure, and shared responsibility questions
- Best understanding: Hybrid deployment and fault tolerance concepts
- Need to remember: Region contains AZs, not the other way around

**Tomorrow's Goals:**
- Start Module 2: Compute in the Cloud
- Learn about Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- Understand EC2 instance types
- Goal: Launch my first virtual server by end of the week

**Notes/Reflections:**
- Cloud computing is essentially renting computer resources instead of owning physical servers
- AWS has massive global infrastructure which provides reliability through redundancy
- The shared responsibility model makes sense - AWS handles physical stuff, I handle my data and configurations
- Excited to actually start building things hands-on with EC2
- Feeling confident about the foundational concepts
- The course structure is clear and well-organized

**Key Takeaway:** Cloud computing lets companies focus on their applications instead of managing physical infrastructure - this is a fundamental shift in how IT works!
