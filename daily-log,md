## 🗓️ Day 1 - October 11, 2025

### ⏱️ Time Investment
**2.5 hours** | Status: ✅ Complete

---

### 📚 What I Learned

#### ☁️ Cloud Computing Fundamentals
- Understanding what cloud computing is and its business value
- Why companies are migrating to the cloud

#### 🏗️ Deployment Models
| Model | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **On-Premises** | Physical servers in your building | Complete control, high cost |
| **Cloud-Based** | Everything on AWS | Scalability, lower overhead |
| **Hybrid** | Mix of both | Gradual migration, compliance |

#### 🌍 AWS Global Infrastructure
```yaml
Structure:
  Regions:
    - Geographic locations (US East, Europe, Asia)
    - Contains multiple Availability Zones
    
  Availability Zones:
    - Separate data centers within a Region
    - Provides redundancy and fault tolerance
    
Benefits:
  - High availability ✅
  - Fault tolerance ✅
  - Low latency globally ✅
```

#### 🔐 AWS Shared Responsibility Model

| AWS Responsibility | Customer Responsibility |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Physical infrastructure | Data encryption |
| Data centers | Applications |
| Hardware | Operating system patches |
| Network equipment | User access control |
| **Security OF the cloud** | **Security IN the cloud** |

#### 🖥️ Client-Server Model
- **Client:** Sends requests (browser, mobile app)
- **Server:** Processes and responds (AWS provides scalable servers)
- **Cloud:** Makes servers accessible over the internet

---

### 🛠️ Hands-On Practice

- [x] Created AWS free tier account
- [x] Enabled MFA on root account
- [x] Set up $0 billing alerts
- [x] Received $100 in free credits (183 days)
- [x] Explored AWS Management Console

---

### 💪 Challenges Overcome

> **Challenge:** Confused about Regions vs Availability Zones  
> **Solution:** Region = City, AZ = Neighborhood analogy helped!

> **Challenge:** Understanding shared responsibility  
> **Solution:** "AWS = Physical, Customer = Digital" mental model

---

### 📝 Quiz Performance

✅ Strong understanding: Deployment models, global infrastructure  
✅ Solid grasp: Shared responsibility model  
⚠️ Review needed: Specific AZ configurations

**Score:** 8/8 questions correct

---

### 🎯 Tomorrow's Goals

- [ ] Start Module 2: Compute in the Cloud
- [ ] Learn about Amazon EC2
- [ ] Understand EC2 instance types
- [ ] Plan first hands-on EC2 deployment

---

### 💭 Reflections

> *"Cloud computing is essentially renting computer resources instead of owning physical servers. This fundamental shift allows companies to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure management."*

**Key Insight:** The shared responsibility model is elegant - AWS handles the heavy lifting (physical), while customers maintain control over their data and applications.

**Feeling:** Confident and excited to move into hands-on compute work!

## 🗓️ Day 2 - October 13, 2025

### ⏱️ Time Investment
**2-3 hours** | Status: ✅ Complete

---

### 📚 What I Learned

#### 💻 Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Virtual servers in the cloud that scale up or down based on demand

#### 🎯 EC2 Instance Types

| Type | Icon | Optimized For | Use Cases | Example |
|------|------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| **General Purpose** | ⚖️ | Balanced resources | Web servers, small DBs | T3, M5 |
| **Compute Optimized** | 🚀 | High CPU performance | Scientific modeling, gaming | C5, C6 |
| **Memory Optimized** | 🧠 | Large RAM | Big databases, caching | R5, X1 |
| **Storage Optimized** | 💾 | High disk I/O | Data warehouses | I3, D2 |
| **Accelerated Computing** | ⚡ | GPU/hardware accelerators | ML, graphics rendering | P3, G4 |

#### 💰 EC2 Pricing Models

```python
pricing_models = {
    "On-Demand": {
        "use_when": "Unpredictable workloads",
        "commitment": "None",
        "cost": "Highest",
        "interruption": "Never"
    },
    "Reserved": {
        "use_when": "Steady-state, predictable",
        "commitment": "1-3 years",
        "cost": "Up to 75% savings",
        "interruption": "Never"
    },
    "Spot": {
        "use_when": "Flexible, interruptible work",
        "commitment": "None", 
        "cost": "Up to 90% savings",
        "interruption": "Possible"
    },
    "Savings Plans": {
        "use_when": "Consistent usage",
        "commitment": "1-3 years",
        "cost": "Flexible discounts",
        "interruption": "Never"
    }
}
```

#### 🔄 Auto Scaling & Load Balancing

**Auto Scaling:**
- Automatically adds instances when demand ↑
- Automatically removes instances when demand ↓
- Based on metrics (CPU, memory, custom)
- Saves costs + ensures performance

**Elastic Load Balancing:**
- Distributes traffic evenly across instances
- Health checks on instances
- Works with Auto Scaling automatically

```
Traffic Flow:
Users → Load Balancer → [EC2] [EC2] [EC2]
                        ↑ Auto Scaling manages count
```

#### 📸 Amazon Machine Images (AMI)
- Template for launching EC2 instances
- Contains OS, applications, configurations
- Ensures consistency across scaled instances

#### 🏢 Multi-Tenancy
- Multiple customers share physical hardware
- Complete isolation through hypervisor
- Like an apartment building analogy
- Cost-efficient while maintaining security

---

### 🛠️ Hands-On Practice
